An Agda version of [*Generic parallel functional programming: Scan and FFT*](http://conal.net/papers/generic-parallel-functional/), this time with full, compositional correctness and relating to "arrays", as discussed in the talk [*Can Tensor Programming Be Liberated from the Fortran Data Paradigm?*](https://github.com/conal/talk-2021-can-tensor-programming-be-liberated).
